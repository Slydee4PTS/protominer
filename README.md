I made this project conversion from jhProtominer available for windows here:

I just convert some few stuff to make it compatible with MAC OS.

If you want to build this application, just create a Terminal project with XCode, insert allsource file to your new created project, build it, and run it!

I also include in the sdProtominer.zip the builded app.

Good luck!
