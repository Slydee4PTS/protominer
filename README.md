I just  made this source conversion from jhProtominer made by jh00 available for Windows OS here: 

https://github.com/jh000/jhProtominer

If you want to build this application, just create a Terminal project with XCode, insert all source file to your new created project, build it, and run it!

I just convert some few stuff to make it compatible with MAC OS and remove compile warnings.

Be free to change this code to fill your needs!

If you do not want to build your own app, I include in the sdProtominer.zip the app.

Good luck!
