I made this project conversion from jhProtominer made by jh00 available for Windows OS here: 

https://github.com/jh000/jhProtominer

If you want to build this application, just create a Terminal project with XCode, insert all source file to your new created project, build it, and run it!

I just convert some few stuff to make it compatible with MAC OS, and change some sleep value to receonnect on lost connection a little bit faster!

Be free to change this code to fill your needs!

If you do not want to build your own app, I include in the sdProtominer.zip the app.

Good luck!
